        <p>Lee Valley Tools is taking its in-store COVID-19 precautions a step further with the launch of a new mobile shopping tool, which incorporates the JavaScript edition of the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader. Integrated with Lee Valley's website, LeeValley.com, the new tool allows for mobile contactless shopping in each of its 20 locations across the country.</p>
        <p>Over the last six months, Lee Valley Tools has enacted a variety of in-store safety measures. The launch of the new mobile feature brings an added level of safety to the in-store shopping experience.</p>

The online feature also allows customers to scan an item's bar code and see a full description of every product offered by Lee Valley Tools before deciding to purchase – from drills to dovetail saws.</p>

    <h3>Healthcare - Track COVID-19 Diagnostic Samples</h3>
    <div class="tabDetail clearfix">
      <div class="descCnt fl">
        <p>We have a customer that is a New York-based company that provides services related to COVID-19 diagnostic testing and other healthcare needs. It has done millions of COVID-19 tests, using barcoding technology to track the samples because accurate recording of COVID-19 diagnostic samples is paramount.</p>
        <p>The key feature that the company requires in their application is 100% accuracy in a web-based barcode scanner. Also, for maximum customer reach, the barcode scanner needs to work on mobile and desktop browsers. The company validated Dynamsoft Barcode Reader against other offerings and found it was the best option. Dynamsoft’s javascript barcode SDK offers many benefits like, ease of implementation, flexible licensing, and ease of use.</p>
        <p>With the help of the barcode SDK, the healthcare company designed their application quickly, in two weeks from the point of planning to actually making it available for use.</p>
