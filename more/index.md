# Achieving Goals Faster with Dynamsoft’s SDKs

## Multiple Codes

## DPM Code Scanning

Direct Part Marking (DPM) is used in electronics manufacturing, automotive industry, medical devices, and aerospace to permanently mark products and parts with crucial product information, such as part numbers, serial numbers, and date codes. While DPM codes help to manage and track devices and components, it can often become challenging to scan these etched codes because of surface imperfections, bad lighting, distortions in dots, and low color and contrast. Dynamsoft Barcode Reader SDK overcomes these [DPM scanning](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Products/direct-part-marking.aspx) challenges by using proprietary algorithmic capabilities.

## Document Management

Document management is essential for organizations to reduce file loss, which impacts the productivity of their workforce. With a high recognition speed and the ability to scan a wide array of barcodes, organizations and professionals save time and effort. 
 
Avision Inc. is a top manufacturer of image scanners and multi-function products. They adopted Dynamsoft Barcode Reader SDK to create new barcode scanning and reading software. [Read the case study >](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Company/case-study-Avision.aspx)
 
Dynamsoft Barcode Reader SDK helped the German Red Cross Society to automate a barcode-to-PDF procedure. [Read the case study >](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Company/case-study-Avision.aspx)

## Parcel Tracking

Parcel tracking involves recording the date and time of the shipment’s arrival, the location it was sent to, and the recipient’s name. Barcodes ensure high speed, accuracy, accountability, and efficiency. With Dynamsoft Barcode Reader SDK, tasks such as searching, tracking, and sorting parcels becomes much easier and faster. 
 
With quick scanning of a large set of barcodes, any type of parcel can be identified in no time. The Dynamsoft Barcode Reader SDK helps to streamline parcel tracking and ensures that packages are delivered faster without errors. 

## Inventory Count

To optimize your supply chain, barcode inventory systems must be controlled and overseen to be efficient and accurate. Missed items result in inaccurate inventory, affecting the entire chain to customers. Barcode tracking software must deliver precision. While most barcode readers promise high recognition accuracy, even a success rate of 99% may not be good enough. [Dynamsoft Panorama™](https://officecn.dynamsoft.com:808/Products/barcode-inventory-system.aspx), an enhanced module of the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader SDK, promises to fix the last 1% of scanning error rates that can collectively cost businesses billions annually. 

## UPS MaxiCode 

A 2-dimensional barcode, [MaxiCode](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Barcode-Types/MaxiCode.aspx), was developed by United Parcel Service in 1992 and is used for sorting and addressing US domestic packages, as well as international. MaxiCode consists of concentric circles or Bullseye, a hexagonal grid, and a fixed number of lines and modules.
 
Although MaxiCode has a distinct design, there may be decoding challenges. The concentric circles may get damaged, the orientation patterns could become distorted, or the sparse dots may confuse a barcode reader. But with Dynamsoft Barcode Reader SDK, users can easily scan these codes.

## Aadhaar Card 

Issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the [Aadhaar card’s QR code](https://www.dynamsoft.com/blog/insights/how-to-extract-aadhaar-card-information/) contains a person’s information, such as full name, date of birth, father’s name, and address. 
With Dynamsoft’s SDKs, developers can easily build a web application to scan multiple Aadhaar cards at once. Users can scan multiple pages, identifying which page is an Aadhaar card and saving the page as a PDF. The barcode SDK can decode the QR code and extract the information of the cardholder. No extra scanning device is required because any mobile device can be used.
