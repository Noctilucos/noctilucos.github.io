      <p>According to the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) <a>specification</a>, PDF417 symbology is used for storing personal information on US driver’s licenses. It comprises critical information about the cardholder, such as their name, gender, date of birth, height, etc. Many organizations, both government and private, use the driver’s license for identification purposes and age verification. Barcode recognition technology is considered more accurate and cost-effective than OCR for extracting data. Because the driver’s license is widely accepted as a form of identification in different areas and is considered the primary method of identification in countries like the US, it is imperative to use a barcode reader that accurately reads and extracts the data.</p>

    <p class="f18">The parser breaks down the decoded PDF417 values into field-value pairs, such as cardholder’s name, eye color, height, date of birth, etc.</p>

        <p>Lee Valley Tools is taking its in-store COVID-19 precautions a step further with the launch of a new mobile shopping tool, which incorporates the JavaScript edition of the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader. Integrated with Lee Valley's website, LeeValley.com, the new tool allows for mobile contactless shopping in each of its 20 locations across the country.</p>
        <p>Over the last six months, Lee Valley Tools has enacted a variety of in-store safety measures. The launch of the new mobile feature brings an added level of safety to the in-store shopping experience.</p>
        <p>The mobile feature is easy to use as customers don't need to download anything on their mobile device, instead they simply visit LeeValley.com when they enter the physical store, click on the barcode icon, select their store location, and start shopping. The online feature also allows customers to scan an item's bar code and see a full description of every product offered by Lee Valley Tools before deciding to purchase – from drills to dovetail saws.</p>
        <p>"The health and safety of our customers and staff is our number one priority and our new easy-to-use mobile feature provides another layer of protection while shopping in-store during these unprecedented times," said Jason Tassé, Chief Operating Officer, Lee Valley Tools. "We're thrilled to launch this mobile tool in all our stores across Canada to give our customers a user-friendly way of making the browsing and purchase process contactless."</p>

    <h3>Healthcare - Track COVID-19 Diagnostic Samples</h3>
    <div class="tabDetail clearfix">
      <div class="descCnt fl">
        <p>We have a customer that is a New York-based company that provides services related to COVID-19 diagnostic testing and other healthcare needs. It has done millions of COVID-19 tests, using barcoding technology to track the samples because accurate recording of COVID-19 diagnostic samples is paramount.</p>
        <p>The key feature that the company requires in their application is 100% accuracy in a web-based barcode scanner. Also, for maximum customer reach, the barcode scanner needs to work on mobile and desktop browsers. The company validated Dynamsoft Barcode Reader against other offerings and found it was the best option. Dynamsoft’s javascript barcode SDK offers many benefits like, ease of implementation, flexible licensing, and ease of use.</p>
        <p>With the help of the barcode SDK, the healthcare company designed their application quickly, in two weeks from the point of planning to actually making it available for use.</p>
