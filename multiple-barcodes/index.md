# Multi-code Barcode Reading with Mobile Devices

Dynamsoft Panorama is a groundbreaking proprietary technology that aims to provide users with industrial-grade whole-warehouse barcode scan capabilities. To achieve true 100% barcode scan success rates, the overlap mode can read multiple barcodes accurately by taking consecutive image frames from a camera video stream in real-time.

When reading multiple barcodes simultaneously, it is difficult to guarantee that all barcodes can be recognized in a single snapshot. The barcodes are relatively small and the visibility is also poor from a distance. The Dynamsoft Panorama overlap mode was born to solve this problem. 
 
Hold your mobile device properly to capture the entire barcode area. This frame serves as the “bird's eye view” image.
For those which are missed, adjust the distance between the camera lens and barcodes until all the barcodes are recognized.
As different barcodes are recognized from different frames, their results are eventually merged into one. Notice how all the barcode values are mapped on to the “bird's eye view” frame. This sophisticated panorama technology can dramatically boost the efficiency of inventory management, logistics, and parcel delivery using mobile devices.

It is easy for developers to integrate the APIs to Android and iOS projects with just a few lines of code. To try the SDK, contact us now or visit our website.
