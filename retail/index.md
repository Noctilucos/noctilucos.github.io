          <h3>UPC-A</h3>
          <span>1D Barcode</span>
          <p>The 1D barcode, <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/Barcode-Types/UPC-A.aspx">UPC-A</a>, is widely used in retail for point-of-sale (POS) scanning. <b>You can spot a UPC-A code on many things, from consumer goods packaging to books, newspapers, and magazines.</b> Common in countries like the United States, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, the UPC-A code encodes 12 digits of barcode data with 11 digits of product information. </p>

          <h3>UPC-E</h3>
          <span>1D Barcode</span>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/Barcode-Types/UPC-E.aspx">UPC-E</a> code is a variation of the UPC-A code. It is more compact because it compresses out the unnecessary zeros, making it only half the size of a UPC-A barcode. UPC-E codes can also be uncompressed back to UPC-A barcodes. <b>Because of its compact size, the UPC-E barcode is used on smaller items where the UPC-A code wonâ€™t fit, such as lip balm sticks.</b> These barcodes are extensively used in countries like the United States and Canada. </p>

          <p><a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/Barcode-Types/EAN-8.aspx">EAN-8</a> barcodes are derived from EAN-13 codes (defined below). <b>They are used on items and in places where limited space is available, such as pencils, small candies, chewing gum packets, cigarettes, etc.</b> The information enclosed in an EAN-8 barcode includes a 2-3-digit country code, a checksum digit, and 4-5 data digits.

          <p>A 13-digit barcoding standard, the <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/Barcode-Types/EAN-13.aspx">EAN-13</a>barcode type was designed by the International Article Numbering Association (EAN) in Europe and is used extensively in European countries. EAN-13 barcodes are used for marking products and to identify specific items at retail POS. In addition to this, these barcodes can also be used for selling batches of products to consumers.</p>

          <p>A low-density numeric symbol, <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/Barcode-Types/Industrial-2-of-5.aspx">the Industrial 2 of 5 code</a>, is so-called because the digits are encoded with 5 bars, 2 of which are always wide. These codes are used in the retail warehouse sorting systems and applications. Therefore, the warehouse staff can easily find the storage location of the product and save time just by scanning the barcode.</p>

It differs from Code 39, which is a continuous symbol and produces a denser code. Code 93 barcodes are used in retail inventory for identifying products. The store staff can easily manage inventory and quickly find the items they are looking for without any problems. </p>

These two components are separated by a separator pattern. <strong>The GS1 Composite codes, such as GS1 DataBar barcodes, are most often used for labeling fresh foods.</strong> The information often enclosed can be the expiry date or batch number of an item.  </p>
